WPFRoundedCornersWithTransparency
=================================

A demo WPF app with rounded corners that has transparency on those corners.

Without the right properties on the window, you can get nasty, sharp backgrounds on the corners of your windows.  If done correctly, the background will show through, giving you a much more polished look.
